<h1>EP Visualizer 2</h1>

<p>Like i said in the last post, i wanted to make quick little visualizers for my eps so i have something to upload to youtube.</p>
<p>For my second EP, Skinnaddiction, i also did that. I put a fisheye lense on my camera, put it down on the floor pointing up towards the sky, and danced around it for a few minutes.</p>

<h2>cutting out myself from the background</h2>
<p>To cut all the versions of myself out of the background in order to rotate them and make it look like there is a bunch of me,
I first wanted to rotobrush the full clip in after effects, but this would have taken wayyyy too long. Then i found out about difference matte.
Its an effect in AE that creates a matte based on the difference between the clip and another layer. To create this other layer, i created a new composition with the clip, then froze the frame
duplicated it and froze a different frame where i was oin the other side of the image. Then i masked the top layer so i was completely cut out of the image.</p>
<br>
<p>then i used the colorama effect in after effects to make it trippy and coloful. Then i also animated the clip to the beat to make it more bouncy. yeah...</p>
